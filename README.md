# Text-Difficulty-TopicModel-Clustering

A. Supervised Learning Model for Predicting Text Difficulty


The purpose of this part is to build a supervised learning classification model where we will be able to predict whether each document(sentence) in the dataset extracted from Wikipedia needs to be simplified.In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the text difficulty. The two classes are defined as following:

Class 0: the sentence does NOT need to be simplified (Not Difficult).

Class 1: the sentence DOES need to be simplified (Difficult).

For supervised learning, we have explored four different types of algorithms. The feature representations are the same for the four models. Itâ€™s the feature representation extracted from Word2Vec using Bag of Words.
